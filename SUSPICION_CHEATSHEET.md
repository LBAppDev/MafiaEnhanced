# Mafia Enhanced: Suspicion Matrix Cheat Sheet

## What is the Suspicion Matrix?
- Every player has a *private* suspicion score for every other player (0-100).
- The higher the score, the more suspicious you are of that player.
- Your actions and others' actions change these scores throughout the game.

## How do actions affect suspicion?
- **Accuse**: Slightly increases suspicion *others* have of your target.
- **Defend**: Slightly decreases suspicion *others* have of your target.
- **Vote for Innocent**: Increases suspicion *others* have of you.
- **Vote for Mafia**: Decreases suspicion *others* have of you.
- **Bandwagon (late vote)**: Increases suspicion *others* have of you.
- **Hypocrisy (accuse X, vote Y)**: Increases suspicion *others* have of you.
- **Consistency (accuse X, vote X)**: Decreases suspicion *others* have of you.
- **Detective Investigation**: Strongly changes your suspicion of the target, and leaks a little to others.
- **Doctor Save**: Doctor and saved player trust each other more (sometimes with error).
- **Rumors**: Occasionally, random suspicion shifts happen to keep things interesting.

## What else affects suspicion?
- **Memory Decay**: Suspicion drifts back toward neutral over time.
- **Confirmation Bias**: If you already suspect someone, bad actions look worse; if you trust them, you forgive more.
- **Misinterpretation**: Sometimes, actions are read the wrong way (random chance).

## Where can I see my suspicions?
- Use the **View Suspicion Matrix** button during the game to see how suspicious you are of each player (only you can see your own matrix).

## Why does this matter?
- The bot's AI and some game events use these scores to make decisions, create drama, and drive the story.
- Play smart: your actions shape how others (and the AI) see you!
